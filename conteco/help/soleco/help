# controlplane.soleco
#
# A controlplane gives access to an API that consists of 7 sections: console, repo, config, build, release, deploy and run.
# Not all controlplanes require the full API for their operations.
#
# The soleco controlplane is concerned with the configuration and running of containerised solutions.
# The name soleco stands for solution ecosystem.
#
# It provides full implementation for repo, build, release, deploy and run and partial implementation of config and console.
# There is no implementation for run.
#
# Each to level API method implements the --info flag returning information relevant to the API method about the image.
